My goal for this project was to build a all around Data Science tool. The program will run and output a prediction based on the data provided

Future update ideas: 
- Adding randomForestRegressor for null data fill in. 
- Adding convert_strings_to_ascii for string based data. (Currently map_seasons)

In Main.py you need to update x_name and y_name.
From there change is_regression if needed. From there the code 
will run a bunch of models and use the best one to output a submition file. 

Heads up depending on Data Size some models can take a very long time. 
This was made to get the best score possable for Competitions. Not always speed.
